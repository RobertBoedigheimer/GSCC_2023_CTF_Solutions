# Please Try Again

### Challenge
**A partial list of users and passwords have been leaked. Can you take over an account?**

The first clue brings you to a simple login page. If you randomly type in a username and password there's a good chance you'll see something like this:

The second link gives you a list of usernames and passwords. As you try different combinations you will notice that the system will let you know when you have given a bad username or password. This is a good sign that you can use a brute force attack to find the correct username and password.

Once you determine one or more good users, try each password in turn until you find one that works. Once you have a working username and password, you can log in and get the flag.
