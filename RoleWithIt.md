# Role With It

### Challenge
**Submit an update to the application settings**

When you "goto clue" you are presented with a screen where you can make changes to application settings. The problem is, the submit button is disabled. You need to figure out how to enable it.

As is often the case, the challenge title holds a clue. You will notice "Role" in the title and "user" in the url. This is a hint that you need to change your user role. You can do this by simply editing the url. You might guess that "admin" will light up the button, and you would be right.
