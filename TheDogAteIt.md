# The Dog Ate It

### Challenge
No matter how you slice it, this challenge is layers upon layers of fun.

This challenge invites you to download a file. It is a .gcode file. If you are not into 3-D printing, you will still Google your way into discovering that this is a file format widely used to describe a sliced 3D model.
[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code):

> G-code (also RS-274) is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. It is used mainly in computer-aided manufacturing to control automated machine tools, as well as for 3D-printer slicer applications. The G stands for geometry. G-code has many variants.

With this knowledge you will try to find out how to view a gcode file. There are online tools available where you can visualize the gcode and if you are into 3D printing you will already have an app for that.

This gcode file, when visualized, will show you something like:

As usual, the title of the challenge is a subtle clue. "No matter how you ***slice*** it..." refers to the fact that a "slicer" has generated this file. A Slicer, such as Ultimaker Cura, will take you 3D model and slice it into tiny layers that your 3D printer can interpret and print.

A gcode visualizer should allow you to view the model layer-by-layer. When you do so, you will see something interesting:

And there you have it. The flag is embedded in the middle of this hollowed out 3D model.

Of course, you could also try printing this model and wait until you see the flag, but that could take a while.
